#NOTE - Pillars of OOPs

#1]  Abstraction:-
  #  Abstraction is like driving a car. You donâ€™t need to understand the intricate details of how the engine works; you only need to know how to use the steering wheel, gas pedal, and brakes to drive.same for the function of codes dont need to know for user.

#2] Encapsulation:-
 #  Encapsulation is like putting your valuables in a safe.     You keep your items secure inside the safe and only use the    combination to access them when needed. assume remote as class & button as method,variables.

#3] Inheritance
#4] Polymorphisms



#---------------------------------------------------------------

# SELF method --> used in function like below


class Anime:
  name = "Naruto"
  hero = "Uzumaki Naruto"          # class atr can be alterby object atr
  side_hero = "Uchiha Sasuke"
  
  def naruto(self):               
     print(f"The name of anime is {self.name}. The name of hero is {self.hero} ")
     
minato = Anime()                     # self = minato,etc in this case 
minato.hero = "Uzumaki Minato"       # here i change class atr(naruto) to obj atr(minato)

minato.naruto()           #or Anime.naruto(minato)

#NOTE:- Object atr >>> Class atr bcz of object atr uniquiness info to identify perticular object also during assingment & retrival


# @STATICMETHOD --> used when there is n use of self and u didnt want to use it 

class Bleach:
  def greet_with_self(self):
    print("Aizen is GOD with self")
    
  @staticmethod       #--> syntax  @staticmethod
  def greet_no_self():
     print("Hello Ichigo ,I m Aizen without self")
     
aizen = Bleach()
aizen.greet_with_self()  #--> self works
aizen.greet_no_self()    #--> no self with static method works


#   __INIT__ METHOD --> - also called Constructor method
                     # - its the only method that runs first as the object/class created or run
                    # - it dont need syntx to run
                    

class Student:

  def __init__(self , name,std):
    self.name = name
    self.std = std
    print("This print using __init__ method directly.")
  
  def greet(self):
    print(f"Hi I am {self.name} in {self.std}")
    
zarhan = Student("Zarhan","12th")          #--> here we can put object info for {init} 
#zarhan = Student()                     it throws error *( missing data for name,std also called positioning argument)

zarhan.greet()
#zarhan.__init__()                   i dont use this then also it print
