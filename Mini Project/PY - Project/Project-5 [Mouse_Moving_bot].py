# NOTE: 

# Drawbacks of This Approach
# --> Cursor Movement: The cursor will pause while waiting for your input, which may not be as smooth or responsive as using threads.
# --> User Experience: You might miss some movements if the input is required at every interval.

# Using threading provides a better user experience for this kind of interactive application, but if you prefer simplicity and don't mind the cursor pausing, the non-threaded version will work as well.

# #NOTE:
# I used threading in the previous example to allow the cursor to move continuously while simultaneously accepting user input. Hereâ€™s why threading is helpful in this case:

# --> Simultaneous Execution: Without threading, the program would need to pause the cursor movement to wait for user input, which isn't what you want. Threading allows both actions to happen at the same time.

# --> Responsiveness: The user can input their choice (to continue or stop) at any time without interrupting the cursor's movement. This creates a more interactive experience.

# --> Simple Control: It makes it easier to manage the state of the cursor movement (running or not) with a simple global variable.
