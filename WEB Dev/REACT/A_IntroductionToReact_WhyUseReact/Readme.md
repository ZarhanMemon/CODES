# Why React?

**1. State Variable**
- We can use states which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page

**2. React ke Components**
- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components

**3. JS-DOM ==> React-DOM easy**
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation

**4. Last point**
- Debugging and maintainance is easy
