// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


// 1. async (Asynchronous Function):

// async is used to declare a function that works asynchronously, meaning it will take some time to complete (for example, waiting for data from an API or waiting for a timer).
// When you declare a function with async, it will always return a Promise.
// The use of async allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that looks synchronous, making it easier to read and understand.

// Example: async function example() { ... }


// 2. await (Wait):

// await is used inside an async function only knowly to pause the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved (finished or setteled).
// This means that await "pauses" the line of code until the result from a Promise comes back.
// await can only be used inside async functions.


// Asynchronous function that returns a promise

async function printD() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("D"); // Resolves the promise with "D" after 3 seconds
    }, 3000);
  });
}


async function main() {            // Main asynchronous function that demonstrates async/await usage

  console.log('A');        

  console.log('B'); 

  console.log('C'); 


  // Using 'await' here pauses the execution of main() until printD() resolves

  let D = await printD();        // Waits for the promise to resolve and stores the result in D
  
  console.log(D);               // Logs "D" after the promise resolves (after 3 seconds)

  console.log('E'); // Logs 'E,F,G' immediately after logging "D"

  console.log('F'); 

  console.log('G'); 
}


main();
